# Queris
An open-source, community driven Q&amp;A platform for programmers

## Open Source
Queris's source code is here on Github, and anyone can suggest changes.

## Beginner friendly
Queris focuses on being beginner friendly, because we're all on the same path when it comes to learning how to program. Some of use are just further along than others. But to save the experts from wading through a bunch of stuff they already know, you can customize your browsing experience to include skill levels.

## Community driven
There are no mods on Queris, and everything is voted on. Duplicates aren't simply deleted or flagged, they're merged, so that everyone can see the right answers. And no one can get downvoted into oblivion. We don't believe this is helpful. At all.

# The purpose of Queris
I'm making Queris because I believe there's something seriously wrong with today's biggest forums for programmers, namely, StackOverflow. It's so evident in the community that it's become an over-used joke, at this point. The community is toxic, the power balance is infuriating, and often times an answer isn't even given at all. I knew that wasn't what it was supposed to be. Join me in making a better alternative to finding answers to questions everyone has had.

# Where to go from here
As you can see, this project has barely begun and is less than half of an actual working prototype. It isn't functional yet. I'm hoping that by the end of September, it will be working, and hopefully I'll make it a real website, rather than just a codebase. There's still a lot to be done, however.
