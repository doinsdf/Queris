# Queris
An open-source, community driven Q&amp;A platform for programmers

## Open Source
Queris's source code is here on Github, and anyone can suggest changes.

## Beginner friendly
Queris focuses on being beginner friendly, because we're all on the same path when it comes to learning how to program. Some of use are just further along than others. But to save the experts from wading through a bunch of stuff they already know, you can customize your browsing experience to include skill levels.

## Community driven
There are no mods on Queris, and everything is voted on. Duplicates aren't simply deleted or flagged, they're merged, so that everyone can see the right answers. And no one can get downvoted into oblivion. We don't believe this is helpful. At all.
